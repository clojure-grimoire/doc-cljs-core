{:doc "Compile ClojureScript to JavaScript with optimizations from Google\n   Closure Compiler producing runnable JavaScript.\n\n   The Closure Compiler (compiler.jar) must be on the classpath.\n\n   Use the 'build' function for end-to-end compilation.\n\n   build = compile -> add-dependencies -> optimize -> output\n\n   Two protocols are defined: IJavaScript and Compilable. The\n   Compilable protocol is satisfied by something which can return one\n   or more IJavaScripts.\n\n   With IJavaScript objects in hand, calling add-dependencies will\n   produce a sequence of IJavaScript objects which includes all\n   required dependencies from the Closure library and ClojureScript,\n   in dependency order. This function replaces the closurebuilder\n   tool.\n\n   The optimize function converts one or more IJavaScripts into a\n   single string of JavaScript source code using the Closure Compiler\n   API.\n\n   The produced output is either a single string of optimized\n   JavaScript or a deps file for use during development.\n  "}
